For now all it does is return your recent games' placements, regardless of ranked, normal, double_up and shows your winrate and number of top#1s*

How to use this script:
python3 test.py api_key

where api_key is your riot developer api key, which can be found on https://developer.riotgames.com/.
Also, your API key expires after one day, therefore you'll have to generate a new one at least once every day.
